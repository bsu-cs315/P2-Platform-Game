## Project Report

### Iteration 1 Reflection
I enjoyed this iteration because I have never made a platformer before. It's pretty simple to make a basic platformer, but getting the movement to feel good can be difficult. I enjoyed making my simple player asset, featuring hyper realistic animations. Making the tilemap made it very easy to make a basic level, and in the future could allow me to create more complex levels. Overall, this iteration was a good time.
